# M6 CHALLENGE - Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## My Task

build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

**Use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.**


## User Story

**AS A** traveler

**I WANT** to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

**SO THAT** I can plan a trip accordingly


## Acceptance Criteria

**GIVEN** a weather dashboard with form inputs

**WHEN** I search for a city

**THEN** I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

**WHEN** I view current weather conditions for that city

**THEN** I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed

**WHEN** I view future weather conditions for that city

**THEN** I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

**WHEN** I click on a city in the search history

**THEN** I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
